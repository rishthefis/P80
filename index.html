    <div><h6>RANDOM PARAGRAPH~
        "Begin today!" That's all the note said
        There was no indication from where it came or who may have written it
        Had it been meant for someone else? Meghan looked around the room, but nobody made eye contact back
        For a brief moment, she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams, but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away
    </h6>
    <h6>Another Random Paragraph~ She had been an angel for coming up on 10 years and in all that time nobody had told her this was possible. The fact that it could ever happen never even entered her mind. Yet there she stood, with the undeniable evidence sitting on the ground before her. Angels could lose their wings.</h6>
